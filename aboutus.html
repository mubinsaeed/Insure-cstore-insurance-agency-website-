                  <p>General Liability insurance provides protection for your company’s current assets, and future earnings, helps resolve financial obligations, legal defense, or judgments awarded to an injured party. GL Coverage may also help defend claims for copyright infringement, false advertising, or libel and slander. Should someone be injured in some way in the course of visiting or doing business with your company, a general liability insurance policy can provide coverage.</p>

                  <p>Umbrella insurance is inexpensive and provides liability protection in situations where other insurance policies do not. The extra layer of coverage, the umbrella, helps protect current assets and future earnings by increasing the limit of insurance available to pay claims or even provide coverage for claims that are not covered by other policies. For example, should an auto accident claim exceed the property limit provided, the umbrella could cover the balance of the claims cost. Otherwise, that dollar difference is going to come out of pocket. Another area umbrella policies offer safeguards is for liability due to slander or defamation of character which are not covered by most general liability policies. Liability claims are filed daily – even frivolous claims.</p>

                      <p>A business owner’s policy or “BOP” is designed specifically for small or medium-sized businesses and combines several types of insurance coverage in single policy package.

          • Property, Products and Completed Operations <br>
          • Equipment Breakdown - Spoilage<br>

                          A workers compensation policy will pay for an employee’s medical costs, lost wages, permanent disability or death benefits that result from a workplace injury or illness. Another part of coverage provided by a workers compensation policy is protection from employee lawsuits. Not only must a business provide a safe work place, it must also make sure that all employees are protected from work place accidents. Three things any business faces without workers compensation coverage:
          <br>
          • Legal Issues
          <br>• Employment – Labor Related Fines
          <br>• Financial Ruin
          <br>
          Even if coverage is not mandatory by state law, the coverage is critical and very much recommended. No one would want to lose their business because of an accident and liability that could have been transferred to an insurance company.
